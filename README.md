# Sorting Methods

This project demonstrates four different sorting algorithms implemented in C#. It is intended for educational purposes, helping to understand and compare basic sorting techniques.

## 🧠 Implemented Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** C#
- **Platform:** .NET
- **Project Files:** `Sorting.csproj`, `Sorting.sln`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ClanyX/Sorting_Methods.git
   cd Sorting_Methods

2. **Build and Run:**

   If you have the .NET SDK installed, you can build and run the project using:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

   Alternatively, open the Sorting.sln file in Visual Studio and run the project from there.

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash

Sorting-Methods/
├── Program.cs         # Main program logic and sorting demos
├── Sorting.csproj     # Project file
├── Sorting.sln        # Visual Studio solution file
```

## 📈 Example Output

When running the program, it demonstrates how each sorting algorithm works on sample arrays. You'll see the arrays before and after sorting, as well as the sorting steps printed to the console.
